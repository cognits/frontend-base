# Frontend Base Template

This project is a starting point for ALL front-end projects. The normal process
should be to include this repository as a [git submodule](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Which basically means
doing the following inside the new project repository:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/cognits/frontend-base.git app
```
